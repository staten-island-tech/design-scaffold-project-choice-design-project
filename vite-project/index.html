                <div class="attractions-box attractions-info">The Brooklyn Bridge, built in 1883, was the longest suspension bridge 
                  in the world by the time of completion. It is 5,989 feet long or 1825 meters from one end to the other. The Brooklyn Bridge 
                  is a suspension bridge that connects Brooklyn to Manhattan. Tourists often walk, run, or bike across the bridge while enoying
                   a stunning view of the Manhattan skyline. They take in the views of both Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Statue of Liberty while 
                   there is still light out and then watch as all the sights come to life with electric wonder.</div>
